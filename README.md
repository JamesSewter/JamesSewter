## Hi there, this is my profile README.

Hello, and welcome to my profile.

I am currently enrolled on Northcoders Sofware Engineering bootcamp in JavaScript.

My first full-stack project is a news website: https://nc-news-js.netlify.app/

You can look at the front-end and back-end repos here:

- Front-end:https://github.com/JamesSewter/nc-news
- Back-end: https://github.com/JamesSewter/Northcoders-News-API

I am looking forward to making more projects and learning more and more each day!
